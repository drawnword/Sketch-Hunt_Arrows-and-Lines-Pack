# Sketch Hunt Arrows and Lines Pack

**Trying to help out, until native Sketch arrows improve**

We all know that the arrowhead styling, on native lines in Sketch app, needs improvement.

This free download was created with the goal of helping out Sketch users by offering a selection of pre-built common arrowhead shapes. These hand-tooled vector arrow objects have been designed for flexibility:

- A variety of arrowhead shapes similar to traditional print and digital designs
- Each basic arrow uses a 2px line
- All elements were created and arranged using whole-pixel values, for easy scaling
- Lines are separate from arrowheads, for ease in extending and editing
- Bonus elements: stylized arrows for diagrams; pre-built dotted and dashed lines styles
